• LEGAL DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION AND SUMMARIZATION  is developed as a robust 
pipeline using Legal BERT  for document classification and BART  models for text 
summarization. The system processes diverse legal documents such as contracts, land 
records, and judgments to accurately categorize them and generate concise, entity -rich 
summaries for enhanced understanding and quick retrieval of relevant  information.  
• NATURAL DISASTER PREDICTION  is developed as a comprehensive machine learning 
framework that addresses data imbalance using SMOTE , ensures data privacy through 
Laplacian noise for differential privacy, and enhances interpretability with LIME  and 
SHAP . The system leverages Random Forest  and XGBoost  classifiers to achieve robust 
predictive accuracy, while providing valuable insights into the critical factors contributing 
to disaster  events.
